This is the company's homepage and was created from scratch using Flash, Actionscript 3.0, PHP, HTML, JavaScript and XML. The front-end was created using Adobe Photoshop CS4 and Flash CS4 and I used E4X with the purpose of retrieving the content from a XML file. 

The purpose of this website was to:

- Present the company services to the clients
- Be Search Engine Friendly - using SWFAdress and alternative text content
- Include a simple and attractive Photo Gallery
- Provide a Quotation page - data is collected in Flash and send to a PHP script for processing
- Provide a Download page with filtering options
- Create an administrators page for content management purposes
