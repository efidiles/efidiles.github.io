This e-commerce website was created to meet some of the company's development plans. They are planning to use it for selling and advertising some of their vehicles and accessories. I created this website using Magento CMS and my contribution to the framework included:

- Customizing the Magento template
- Creating a new layout for the product's pictures
- Installing and customizing LightBox plug-in to preview pictures
- Adding and customizing the slideshow displayed on the homepage and the catalogue's page
- Redesigning the slideshow's behaviour in order to import the data from the Magento's database
- Adding a backend facility which indicated if a product is displayed in the slideshow or not
- Creating product types and adding new attributes to products
- Simplifying the backend menus for editors
- Removing unnecessary fields that were required when editors tried to add new products
- Installing plug-in and changing different settings to optimize the speed
- Creating templates for newsletter, adding new payment methods etc.

For this website I used Adobe Photoshop CS4 to maintain the front-end and PHP, HTML, DHTML, Javascript for development purposes. The data is stored in a MySQL database and it's accessed mainly through Magento's API.
