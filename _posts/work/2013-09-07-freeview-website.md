Rebuilding Freeview's website: <a href="http://www.freeview.co.uk" target="_blank">www.freeview.co.uk</a>

Sole developer of Freeview's new website (backend and frontend). Launched on 26th March 2013 as a complete rebuild from ezPublish to Wordpress. Apart from the new design and frontend improvements, the new website received a lot of focus in building a logical, simple and intuitive backend (the backend being the main factor of decision to completely replatform the website).

In addition to the actual build, the following requirements have been implemented:

- Creation of cronjob scripts to import content feeds into the database
- Add Reevoo integration to products
- Create products export script to push content to Reevoo
- TV Genius (Red Bee) integration and feed consuming
- Reusable and embeddable competition module using Gravity Forms
- Integration with eCircle newsletter subscription
- Facebook integration, Google analytics, etc
