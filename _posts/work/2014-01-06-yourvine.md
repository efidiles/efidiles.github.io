Developed a questions and answers game (web app) used for marketing purposes. The app uses LinkedIn's API and allows users to challenge their connections to beat set scores. The web app was built using AngularJS and the data was fetched from a Django server.

Other contributions included a signup page for Bestival 2013 and website for Let's go holdings.
